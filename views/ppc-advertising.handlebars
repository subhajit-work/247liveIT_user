               </div>
               <p>We create and implement sophisticated pay-per-click advertising campaigns with Google Adwords that result in lead generation, increased website traffic and conversion rate growth.</p>
               <p><b>What Is PPC Advertising?</b></p>
               <p>With pay-per-click advertising, a business pays each time someone clicks on its online advertisement. PPC ads appear prominently on Google search results after a desired phrase is entered into the search box (i.e., "Italian restaurants near me,"). These ads look similar to organic search results but will have "Ad" displayed next to the entry.
                  PPC ads typically appear on the first page of searches. To determine ad placement ranking, Google, for example, evaluates the quality of the ad, relevancy to the topic search, number of competing ads, monetary bid per ad and other factors. Bing and other search engines work much the same way.
               </p>
               <p><b>Why PPC Advertising?</b></p>
               <p>When done right, PPC enables businesses to quickly target audiences expressly interested in their products or services. A click on an ad takes the viewer to a homepage or customized landing page directly addressing the viewer's interests. A predetermined advertising budget assures that there won't be surprises. Click-through statistics are provided to gauge ad campaign success. Our job is to keep campaigns fresh, relevant and producing results.</p>
